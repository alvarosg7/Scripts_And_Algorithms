# Exercise 1: FizzBuzz
# Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 50. 
# For multiples of 3, print "Fizz".
# For multiples of 5, print "Buzz".
# For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

# Exercise 2: Prime Number Checker
# Write a program that checks if a number (from user input) is a prime number.
# A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.

number = int(input('enter your number here: '))

# Exercise 3: Multiplication Table
# Write a program that generates the multiplication table for numbers from 1 to 10.
# Each number should display its multiplication results from 1 to 10.


for k in range(1, 11):
    for h in range(1, 11):
        print(f"{k} x {h} = {k *h}")
    print() #Print a blank line between multiplication tables


# Exercise 4: Finding the Largest Number
# Write a program that takes a list of numbers from the user (comma-separated).
# Use a loop to find and print the largest number in the list.

user_input = input("Enter your list of comma-separated numbers here: ")
user_list = [int(n) for n in user_input.split(',')]

largest = user_list[0]

for num in user_list:
     if num > largest:
          largest = num

print('The largest number is: ', largest)




# Exercise 5: Guess the Number
# Write a program that:
# Randomly picks a number between 1 and 100.
# Allows the user to guess the number. 
# After each guess, tells the user if the number is too high, too low, or correct.
