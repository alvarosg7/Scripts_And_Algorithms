# Powershell returns data as objects, not plain text. This allows you to manipulate and format data easily

Get-Process

# Each process is an object with properties like Name, Id, CPU, and more. You can view a specific property:

(Get-Process -Name notepad).CPU


# List all processes and filter for those consuming significant CPU (>10)

Get-Process | Where-Object{$_.CPU -gt 10}


# Explanation
# Get-Process: Retrieves a list of all running processes.
# |: The pipeline operator passes the output of Get-Process to the next cmdlet.
# Where-Object: Filters objects based on a condition.
# $_: Represents the current object in the pipeline.
# $_.CPU: Accesses the CPU property of the current object.
# -gt 10: Filters processes where the CPU value is greater than 10.
